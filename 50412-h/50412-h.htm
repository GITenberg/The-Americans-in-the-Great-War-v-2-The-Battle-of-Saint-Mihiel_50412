<p class="c">WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE ITS USES?</p>

<p>The “Touring Club de France” (founded in 1890), is at the present time
the largest Touring Association in the whole world. Its principal aim is
to introduce France&mdash;admirable country and one of the loveliest on
earth&mdash;to French people themselves and to foreigners.</p>

<p>It seeks to develop travel in all its forms, on foot, on horseback, on
bicycle, in carriage, motor, yacht, or railway, and soon in aeroplane.</p>

<p>Every member of the Association receives a badge and an identity ticket
free of charge, as also the “Revue Mensuelle” every month.</p>

<p>Members have also the benefit of special prices in a certain number of
affiliated hotels; and this holds good for the purchase of guide-books
and Staff (Etat-major) maps, as well as those of the “Ministère de
l’Intérieur,” the T. C. F., etc. They may insert notices regarding the
sale or purchase of traveling requisites, in the “Revue” (1 fr. per
line). The “Comité des Contentieux” is ready to give them counsel with
regard to traveling, and 3,000 delegates in all the principal towns are
able to give them advice and information about the curiosities of art or
of nature in the neighborhood, as well as concerning the roads, hotels,
motor-agents, garages, etc.</p>

<p>Members are accorded free passage across the frontier for a bicycle or
motor-bicycle. For a motor-car the Association gives a “Triptyque”
ensuring free passage through the “douane,” etc.</p>

<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD<br /><br />
THE ST. MIHIEL VICTORY, SEPTEMBER, 1918</h2>

<p>The world already knows of the undying glory achieved in the Great War
by the American Soldiers, but perhaps less is known about the historic
ground over which they fought.</p>

<p>The purpose of the present volume is more to describe, for the benefit
of the tourist, that section of France where the battle of Saint-Mihiel
raged, than to dwell on the splendid achievements of the brave troops
from across the seas, who took that ancient stronghold, and thus opened
the way to Metz.</p>

<p>At the same time it is fitting to remind the reader that at Saint-Mihiel
the Americans liberated over 150 square miles of French territory; took
over 15,000 German prisoners, and captured upwards of 200 guns.</p>

<p>President Poincaré, in a message to President Wilson, expressed in the
following words, the feelings of France regarding the glorious
achievements of the American troops: “I congratulate you, Mr. President,
on a victory which has been completed so brilliantly. General Pershing’s
magnificent divisions have just liberated with admirable dash, cities
and villages of Lorraine which have been groaning for years under the
yoke of the enemy. I express the warmest thanks of France to the people
of the United States.”</p>

<p>Marshal Foch, also, expressed the greatest possible admiration for the
way the American troops fought their way to the great victory at
Saint-Mihiel. In describing the battle Marshal Foch said: “This was
where the Americans for the first time showed their worth. This is where
we were able to judge of these admirable soldiers, strong in body and
valiant in soul. In one swoop they reduced the famous salient, which
during so long we did not know how to approach.”</p>

<p>In closing this brief introduction the publisher wishes to say that it
would have been an easy matter to fill the pages following with many
high-sounding phrases and verbose descriptions, but it has been thought
better to adhere to the facts (they speak for themselves), and to
furnish the tourist as briefly as possible with an historically correct
account of the great victory of Saint-Mihiel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span></p>

<p><i>In constructing these defences, Gen. Séré de Rivières’ plans provided

bridges being within range of the guns of the forts on the Meuse
Heights. The quadrilateral formed by Woëvre Plain was open to the

<h2>THE MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT (1914-1918).</h2>

<p class="cb">The Frontier in 1914</p>

<p class="c">(<i>See map, <a href="#page_8">p. 8.</a></i>)</p>

<p>If we look at a map of the Franco-German frontier of 1914, between Nancy
and Verdun, it will be seen that two rivers&mdash;the Meuse and the
Moselle&mdash;ran parallel with the frontier, forming a double line of
defences. The Moselle is protected by the hills of that name, and the
Meuse by the Heights of Meuse, the eastern side of which, facing
Germany, consists of a series of steep cliffs.</p>

<p>When, in 1875, General Séré de Rivières was instructed to fortify this
frontier, his plans provided for the construction of a line of forts
along the Meuse Heights, capable of holding the bridges across the Meuse
under gunfire, and thus enable the French Armies to concentrate behind
the river near Neufchâteau. The three northern forts, therefore, faced
the Meuse; the southern forts, viz., Gironville and Liouville, commanded
both the Meuse and the Woëvre.</p>

<p>The drawback to this plan was that the vast Woëvre Plain lying between
Stenay, Longwy, Toul and Nancy, would be sacrificed in the event of a
surprise attack. The importance of this possible loss was made all the
greater by the discovery of coalfields in the Briey district. It was
therefore decided that a number of battalions of Chasseurs should be
garrisoned in the Woëvre towns. Moreover, the passing of the Three
Years’ Military Service Bill made it possible to increase considerably
the number of covering troops. In 1914, the Plan of Concentration
provided for the grouping of the French Third Army in the Woëvre Plain.
However, no permanent defences were erected. The fortress of Longwy,
being isolated and of little military value, could not give effective
protection.</p>

<p>The German Government had on several occasions given the French
Government to understand that they would disapprove the erection of
fortifications in Woëvre. On the other hand, the Germans unceasingly
strengthened their own frontier from Metz to Thionville, increasing the
perimeter of the entrenched camp of Metz from 25 to 90 kilometres and
erecting ten new forts. All the attacks against the Meuse Heights
started from this vast entrenched camp, which, for four years, also
furnished the German lines of St. Mihiel with troops.</p>

<p>September 7, 1914, and the following days were particularly anxious ones
for General Sarrail’s army which, resting as it did on Verdun, was to
form the pivot of Joffre’s famous manœuvre (<i>see the Michelin
Illustrated Guide</i>: “The Battlefields of the Marne, 1914”).</p>

<p class="c">(<i>See map, <a href="#page_10">p. 10.</a></i>)</p>

<p>A furious frontal attack was made on this army by the ex-Crown Prince of
Germany, while at the same time it was taken in the rear, on the Meuse
Heights, by the Bavarian Crown Prince. Had the latter succeeded in
crossing the Meuse, Verdun would have become untenable; General Sarrail
would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a>{10}</span> been forced to retreat southwards, and, as in this gigantic
battle of the Marne all the armies were interdependent, such a
withdrawal would have been felt all along the line, and Joffre’s plans
for a strategical recovery would have failed.</p>

<p>On September 8, the Germans bombarded the Fort of Troyon. The Governor
of Verdun telegraphed to the officer in command of the fort that victory
depended upon his resistance, and requested him to hold out
“indefinitely.” As a precautionary measure, General Sarrail ordered
several of the bridges across the Meuse to be destroyed.</p>

<p>On September 9, the fort’s guns were put out of action, but the
defenders repulsed several assaults. Génicourt Fort was next bombarded.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FIRST GERMAN ATTACKS AGAINST THE MEUSE HEIGHTS</p>

<p><i>While the Battle of the Marne was raging, the Germans attempted in vain
to capture the Meuse Heights, in order to take Gen. Sarrail’s Army&mdash;the
pivot of Joffre’s manoeuvre&mdash;in the rear.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>On the 10th, the forts were still holding out, although deluged with
shells. Meanwhile the German infantry advanced towards St. Mihiel.</p>

<p>However, the Battle of the Marne had now been won on the left wing, and
the German retreat, which was to extend as far as the Verdun&mdash;St. Mihiel
district, had begun.</p>

<p>General de Castelnau despatched the 73rd Reserve and 2nd Cavalry
Divisions of his army to Troyon, and the fort was relieved on September
13. The mobile defence forces of Verdun pursued the retreating Germans
across the Meuse and established themselves to the east of the town,
while General Sarrail’s army advanced towards the north and west.</p>

<p>The German plan had completely failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a>{11}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FORMATION OF THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT (<i>Sept. 20-29,
1914</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Their set-back at Troyon did not prevent the Germans reforming, and they
attacked the Meuse Heights again on September 20, in an endeavour to
outflank Verdun from the south. Four army corps under General von
Strantz, starting from Metz, advanced rapidly on the 22nd to the
Combres-Vigneulles-Thiaumont line, and began a methodical bombardment of
the forts on the Meuse Heights. These were soon pounded into shapeless
heaps of <i>débris</i>, but the gallant defenders still held on and repulsed
all assaults.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the enemy advanced to Seicheprey. The mobile defence forces
of the region, greatly outnumbered (two or three to one), formed only a
very thin line, the depth of which steadily decreased as it extended
beyond Verdun to the south.</p>

<p>On September 24, the German attacks were renewed with increased fury. On
the 25th, they succeeded in gaining a footing on the Meuse Heights near
Vigneulles, whence they advanced to St. Mihiel, which they entered
without, however, crossing the Meuse. At this point the river was only
defended by one battalion of Territorials, and the Germans were able to
cross on the 26th, after which they began to advance towards the valley
of the Aire, in the direction of Verdun. The situation was critical. The
16th Corps from Nancy met and defeated the German forces, and obliged
them to fall back in disorder on the suburbs of St. Mihiel, but were
unable to force them back across the river. On September 29, the front
line ran through Combres, Chauvoncourt, Apremont and Seicheprey.</p>

<p>The salient had been made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a>{12}</span></p>

</div>

<p>From November 17-20 the French endeavoured to drive the Germans from the
bridgehead which the enemy held at Chauvoncourt, opposite St. Mihiel. In
a spirited attack they drove the Germans from the suburb and barracks of
Chauvoncourt. However, the latter had been mined, the Germans, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a>{13}</span>
advantage of the confusion caused by the explosion, counter-attacked and
reoccupied Chauvoncourt.</p>

<p>This was the last attack made at the point of the salient. Only local
fighting of extreme violence now took place in Apremont Forest, the
result of which was, the French prevented the Germans extending the
salient.</p>

<p>French offensives were launched against the northern and southern sides
of the salient, at Eparges and Prêtre Wood, in the hope of narrowing the
salient and forcing the Germans to evacuate it. Eparges Crest was
conquered after more than two months of the fiercest possible fighting,
ending on April 9, 1915.</p>

</div>

<p>However, these local actions were insufficient, and little by little the
line became fixed. Both sides entrenched themselves and bombarded each
other unceasingly, while the sappers carried out long and strenuous
mining operations. Attacks were henceforth confined to small local
objectives: a wood, house, bridge or crater, and it required the great
American offensive of September, 1918, to flatten out this salient
which, for four years, had formed a huge “pocket” inside the French
lines.</p>

<h4>The Salient during the Battle of Verdun</h4>

<p>The German offensive, which began on February 21, 1916, caused a slight
withdrawal along the whole of the French Verdun-Nancy line (<i>see the
Michelin Illustrated Guide</i>: “Verdun”). The French line was withdrawn
behind Fresnes, passing thence round Eparges Crest, which formed a
hinge.</p>

<p>After the French counter-offensive of July-September, 1917, which
disengaged Verdun and the immediate vicinity, their positions were
further improved by a series of local operations at Eparges and around
Pont-à-Mousson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a>{14}</span></p>

<h3>THE AMERICAN OFFENSIVE OF SEPTEMBER, 1918</h3>

<p>It has been seen in the <i>Michelin Illustrated Guide</i>: “The Americans in
the Great War,” Vol. I., that the 1st and 3rd American Corps, under the
respective commands of Major-Generals Liggett and Bullard, reached the
Vesle at the beginning of August, 1918. General Pershing’s intention at
that time was to use these two army corps to form the American First
Army which, under his personal command, was to relieve the French 6th
Army (General Degoutte). However, the Germans having given proof of
their intention to defend the Vesle line at all cost, Marshal Foch
decided to attack at another point of the front, and entrusted the task
of flattening out the salient to the American Army.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a>{15}</span></p>

<p>This operation had already been carefully studied by the American Staff,
for it was in this region that the first American divisions were trained
in active warfare.</p>

<p>The 1st Division was holding the sector extending from Ailly Wood to
Mortmare Wood, when it was relieved by the 26th Division on April 2,
1918, and despatched to the Somme, where it covered itself with glory by
the capture of Cantigny. On April 20, the 26th Division withstood a
powerful surprise attack at Seicheprey, where, after losing part of the
village, it succeeded in fully re-establishing its front. On July 10, it
was sent from the Woëvre district to take part in the Battle of the
Ourcq.</p>

<p>From January, 1918, the 2nd Division held that part of the front lying
between Eparges and Spada Pass, where it received a thorough training,
the effects of which the Germans were destined to feel around
Château-Thierry in June, 1918.</p>

<p>On August 30, General Pershing took over the command of the First Army,
with Headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois. At that time, the front line of
the salient ran as follows: from Eparges Crest it descended in an almost
straight line to St. Mihiel, along the Meuse Heights; passing thence
round St. Mihiel, the great bend in the Meuse and the Camp des Romains,
it described a vast semicircle; then turning sharply eastwards, it
proceeded towards Pont-à-Mousson, passing through the woods of Apremont,
Ailly, Mortmare and Le Prêtre.</p>

<p>The total length of the salient front was about 65 km., and its width
along the German lines between Eparges and Regniéville (near Prêtre
Wood) about 39 km. It penetrated the French lines to a maximum depth of
22 km.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ST. MIHIEL SALIENT PRIOR TO THE OFFENSIVE OF SEPT., 1918</p>

<p><i>It measured 39 km. across its greatest width, 22 km. in depth, and
about 65 km. along its front.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a>{16}</span></p>

<p>Since 1916 this important salient had been fairly quiet, and beyond
intermittent bombardments&mdash;which showed that the lines on both sides
were defended and that the artillery was on the alert&mdash;and a few local
attacks, the communiqués had nothing to report. This salient, however,
greatly hampered the French lines of communication, cutting as it did
the railway between Verdun and Toul. This line, which runs as far as
Epinal and Belfort, linked up these four great eastern fortresses before
the war.</p>

<h4>The Defences of the Salient</h4>

<p class="c">(<i>See map below.</i>)</p>

<p>Through aerial observations and prisoners taken during raids, the
American High Command knew that the enemy possessed several lines of
defences, one behind the other, in the salient, and that beyond the
first line of trenches facing the front was a second line known as the
Schroeter Zone, which formed a second salient about 5 km. within the
first. This line began north-east of Eparges, and went southwards across
the Meuse Heights, then descending eastwards near Varvinay as far as
Buxières, afterwards passing behind the deep valley of the Rupt-de-Mad,
and lastly going in a north-easterly direction through Nonsard,
Lamarche, Beney and Xammes, where it joined up with the Michel line. The
latter formed part of the system of defences known as the <i>Hindenburg
Line or Kriemhilde Position</i>&mdash;considered impregnable by the Germans, and
of which they said to the Allies: “Thus far, and no further”&mdash;and it was
there that the final enemy stand in the salient was to be made.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a>{17}</span></p>

<h4>The Opposing Forces</h4>

<p class="c">(<i>See map below.</i>)</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Fuchs, Commander of the German forces in the salient,
had eight divisions in the line and five divisions of reserves.</p>

<p>These divisions formed part of the forces of General von Gallwitz,
commanding the army group, and it was he who really opposed the
Americans.</p>

<p>On this front General Pershing had four army corps disposed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The 1st Corps, comprising the 82nd, 90th, 5th and 2nd Divisions,
commanded by Major-General Hunter Liggett, operated from Clémery, east
of the Moselle, to Limey.</p>

<p>The 4th Corps, consisting of the 89th, 42nd and 1st Divisions, commanded
by Major-General Joseph T. Dickman, operated from Limey to Xivray.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE OPPOSING FORCES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1918
OFFENSIVE</p></div>
</div>

<p>To these two Corps was assigned the task of carrying out the main
attack, their objective being the Vigneulles-St. Benoit-Xammes line,
which was to be reached in three successive rushes.</p>

<p>The 5th American Corps, composed of the 26th and 4th Divisions under
Major-General George H. Cameron, and supported by the French 15th
Division, carried out a secondary attack from Mouilly to Watronville,
the objectives being, first the capture of the crests of Eparges and
Combres, then the Combres-Vigneulles line. The Corps was to join hands
in the latter village with the troops engaged in the main attack.</p>

<p>The French 2nd Colonial Corps, first under General Blondlat and
afterwards General Claudel, operated in the centre of the salient, from
Xivray to Mouilly, with orders to protect the flanks of the two American
attacks.</p>

<p>The attacking forces consisted of some 216,000 Americans and 48,000
French, in addition to the American Reserves (190,000 men), who were
ready at a moment’s notice to take part in the battle.</p>

<p>In his official report General Pershing stated that he had mustered a
body of troops three times as large as General Grant’s Army of the
Potomac in 1864-1865.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a>{18}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>SHOWING THE AMERICAN-FRENCH ADVANCE FROM SEPT. 12 (12/9)
TO NOV. 11 (11/11), 1918</p>

<p><i>Two secondary attacks on Sept. 12 held the enemy at the bottom of the
salient, while the main attacks on the flanks crushed in the latter, as
in the jaws of a vise. On Sept. 13, the Germans, in danger of being cut
off, were forced to evacuate the salient.</i></p></div>
</div>

<h4>Flattening out the Salient, Sept. 12, 1918</h4>

<p class="c">(<i>See map above.</i>)</p>

<p>Despite all the precautions taken by General Pershing to ensure the
secrecy of his troops’ movements in the St. Mihiel sector, the Germans
expected the attack, and as early as the beginning of September began to
withdraw their heavy guns, and to make active preparations for the total
evacuation of the salient. However, General Pershing did not give them
time to do this, and ordered the attack to be made on September 12, at 5
a.m. for the 1st and 4th Corps, and at 8 a.m. for the 5th Corps.</p>

<p>The attack had been worked out in minute detail, and the time-table of
the advance exactly laid down. Everything took place as arranged. After
an artillery preparation lasting four hours, the American divisions
advanced, supported by a certain number of tanks, half of them driven by
Americans and the other half by Frenchmen. Accompanied by soldiers whose
duty it was to cut the barbed wire, and by men armed with “bangalore
torpedoes,” the Americans advanced in successive waves. They soon
reached the enemy trenches and fell unexpectedly on the demoralized foe
in the middle of a fog.</p>

<p>On September 12 (12/9) the 1st Corps quickly took Thiaucourt, whilst the
4th Corps, operating on the left, advanced beyond Montsec and reached
Nonsard, further north. At the point of the salient, the 2nd French
Colonial Corps gradually attained the objectives assigned to it. The 2nd
Cavalry Division captured more than 2,500 prisoners with a loss of only
fourteen men killed and 116 wounded. At the other end, the 5th American
Corps carried the crests of Eparges and Combres, repulsed a
counter-attack, and quickly joined hands with the patrols of the 4th
Corps at Vigneulles.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 13 (13/9), Generals Pershing and Pétain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a>{19}</span>
entered St. Mihiel. In the evening the new front line ran as follows:
Herbeuville, Thillot-sous-les-Côtes, Hattonville, St. Benoit, Xammes,
Jaulny, Norroy.</p>

<p>It was a fine victory: 16,000 prisoners, 443 guns of all calibres, and
huge quantities of stores and munitions were captured, with a loss of
only 7,000 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The German retreat continued on September 14 and 15 (14/9 and 15/9) to
the line Fresnes&mdash;Hautmont&mdash;Rembercourt.</p>

<p>The offensive was finished; the jaws of the vise had closed on the
salient, and the latter had disappeared. From the American advance-posts
the out-works of Metz were now plainly visible, and Wagner Fort,
situated in front of the town, was already under the fire of the
American guns.</p>

<h4>German Comments on the Attack</h4>

<p>A German report on the American attack of the St. Mihiel salient
contains the following:&mdash;“<i>The Americans made a clever use of their
machine-guns. They are stubborn in defence, and rely greatly upon this
weapon, of which they have large numbers.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The artillery preparation, which preceded the attack, was well carried
out. The objectives were efficiently bombarded. The American gunners
were able to change their targets in the minimum of time, and with great
accuracy. The liaison between the infantry and the artillery was
faultless. Whenever the infantry were stopped by a nest of machine-guns,
they immediately fell back, and their artillery promptly shelled the
nest of machine-guns.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Numerous tanks were ready, but only a few actually used; the masses of
infantry alone ensured the victory.</i>”</p>

<h4>France’s Congratulations</h4>

<p>Immediately after the first American successes in the salient, the
President of the French Republic cabled his warmest congratulations to
President Wilson for the victory of “<i>General Pershing’s magnificent
divisions, fraternally seconded by French troops</i>.”</p>

<p>The praise was well deserved, as in two days the Americans had liberated
150 square miles of French territory which had been occupied four years
by the enemy.</p>

<h4>St. Mihiel Front from Sept. 15 to Armistice Day</h4>

<p>During the great Meuse-Argonne Battle, fought by General Pershing’s
troops after September 26, the operations on the St. Mihiel front were
limited to intermittent bombardments and local attacks.</p>

<p>When the Armistice was signed on November 11, General Pershing was
making dispositions to invest Metz by an offensive towards Longwy with
the 1st Army, and towards Briey with the 2nd Army, while a detachment of
six American divisions was to co-operate on the right bank of the
Moselle with General Mangin’s Army, in an attack on Château-Salins.
Meanwhile, the Germans had already begun to evacuate Metz. The Allies’
advance began on November 10 and 11, but the general capitulation of the
Germans, on terms dictated by the Allies, robbed the Americans of a new
and crushing victory, which would have fittingly crowned their fine
success at St. Mihiel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a>{21}</span></p>

<h4>Calonne Trench</h4>

<p>This picturesque road enables the tourist to follow the phases of the
struggle which took place in the district of Les Eparges. The road
crosses in an almost straight line the whole forest of Amblonville,
Bouchot Wood, and La Montagne Forest, and comes out about twelve miles
further on at the Hattan-châtel cross-roads. Formerly this road was used
only by poachers, gamekeepers, and shooting-parties, being a well-known
haunt of game.</p>

<p>Calonne Trench will, in future, evoke more tragic memories. The name
“Trench” might lead one to suppose that it dates from the Great War, but
this is not the case. For more than a century the road, cut out of the
crest of the hills, has borne this name. It was made by order of M. de
Calonne, Minister of Finance under Louis XVI., to give access to his
château at the foot of the Meuse hills. This château was destroyed
during the Revolution.</p>

<p>It is said that M. de Calonne, hoping some day to entertain the king at
his château, had rose-trees planted the whole length of this road.
However that may be, it is a fact that during the War wild roses were
seen in bloom all along this forest road, at that time really a “trench”
in the military sense of the word.</p>

<p>The battle-front crossed Calonne Trench a little to the south-west of
St. Remy, in Bouchot Wood. Both adversaries bombarded each other and
were kept constantly on the alert by attacks and counter-attacks. In
March, 1915, 5.5-in. naval guns with a range of 13,000 yards were placed
in position, to fire over Les Eparges, behind the enemy lines.</p>

<p>The marines had great difficulty in bringing these heavy guns into
action, owing to the slippery, clayey soil.</p>

</div>

<p>Their effective bombardment irritated the Germans so much that on April
20 they bombarded the French lines and, four days later, launched a
massed attack which reached the third line of support.</p>

<p>The marine officers, cut off from their base and unable to communicate
with the infantry&mdash;the telephone wires being cut&mdash;hastily organised
defences. They swept the ground with the fire of their heavies and some
75’s brought up by hand, which opened at fuse 0.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Germans continued to advance. On the 25th they were within
a thousand yards of the guns, and only vestiges of the trenches and of
the original barbed wire entanglements lay between them and the guns. On
the 26th, while the marines were preparing a vigorous resistance, two
battalions of French Chasseurs, summoned to reinforce them, crept
through the brushwood and began a counter-attack. On the 27th, the
firing became more distant, but the Germans re-formed and renewed the
attack on May 5. At first they met with some success, but this was
quickly changed by the intervention of the Moroccan Brigade and six
battalions of Chasseurs, who retook in a few hours all the ground lost
on April 24.</p>

<p>Calonne Trench enters the forest almost immediately. On both sides of
the road are numerous engineer and artillery parks, ambulance stations,
shelters, rail-tracks and gun-pits.</p>

Eparges on the French side (<i>photo, p. <a href="#page_29">29</a></i>).</p>

<p>It is a desolate scene. The side of the hill is full of craters and
shell-holes, forming so many grey patches on the reddish earth on which
no vegetation survives. The glorious crest, entirely bare, stands out
against the sky. Death Ravine, where so many brave men fell in the first
assault on Eparges, lies between Montgirmont (<i>where the tourist
stands</i>) and Eparges.</p>

<h4>Eparges Spur</h4>

<p>Eparges Spur, 1,500 yards in length and over a thousand feet high, forms
the end of Woëvre Plain. Its sides are steep and slippery, while
numerous springs and rivulets run down its slopes. It has been rightly
called “a mountain of mud.” Eparges Heights form part of a series of
hills, among which are Hures, Montgirmont, Combres and St. Remy. Of
these, Eparges Crest is the most important. By nature an
observation-post, its possession enabled those who held it to keep all
the surrounding roads under gunfire.</p>

<p>The Germans captured it on September 21, 1914, and immediately made
several lines of trenches between the summit and the valleys. At some
points, five rows of batteries, one above another, were placed, and
nowhere were there less than two.</p>

<p>Facing Eparges Crest, the French held the brow of Montgirmont to the
north, and below, the village of Eparges, only 600 yards from the German
trenches. Between Montgirmont and the northern slopes of Eparges
Heights, an earth track crosses the pass between the two hills. It was
on the western side that, at the end of October, the French began the
attack, sapping step by step, while at the same time they slipped into
the woods on the north-east, which cover the side of the ravine.</p>

<p>From February onward, attacks and counter-attacks took place almost
daily and only came to an end early in April, after the French had
captured the crest. On February 17, the explosion of a mine enabled the
French to enter the west sector of the enemy’s first line. Attacks and
counter-attacks continued for five days, during which Colonel Bacquet
was mortally wounded while leading his troops. The French held the whole
of the western bastion, and began to make progress towards the eastern
bastion. From March 13 to 21 they renewed their attacks and captured the
enemy’s first line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a>{32}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>EPARGES IN 1915. SENTRY IN TRENCH</p></div>
</div>

<p>On March 27, a battalion of Chasseurs made a fresh advance, and on April
5 began the last great attack which was to continue day and night until
the 9th.</p>

<p>Two regiments attacked in the rain, but the muddy ground greatly impeded
their movements, and it seemed at times as if the attack would fail.</p>

<p>In the evening the French occupied some of the trenches, but the use of
aerial torpedoes, which pulverized whole rows of men, and a massed
counter-attack launched at 4.30 on the morning of the 6th, forced them
to give up part of the ground gained in the first advance. On the
evening of the 6th, and throughout that night, in spite of the incessant
rain, the trenches were retaken and the enemy driven back foot by foot,
with a loss of 100 prisoners, including several officers. The French
replied to the German counter-attacks with bayonet charges or barrage
fire. The communicating trenches were bombarded, levelled, or blocked
up. On the 8th, two regiments of infantry and a battalion of Chasseurs
made a fresh bayonet charge. At 10 o’clock the summit and the western
crest were strongly held, and by midnight, after fifteen hours of
strenuous, uninterrupted fighting, almost the whole of the crest was in
the hands of the French.</p>

<p>During the night of the 8th, the relief of the troops was carried out,
but the ground was so muddy that men sank into it, stumbling and
slipping at every step. Fourteen hours passed in blinding rainstorms
before the fresh troops were established in position. At 3 o’clock in
the afternoon of the 9th the attack was resumed. The ground was full of
deep holes in which men sometimes disappeared. At the moment when the
eastern edge of the plateau was reached a cloud of fog descended over
the crest. Firing was out of the question. The Germans counter-attacked
and forced the French to retreat momentarily, but half an hour later the
French retook the lost ground in a furious charge, and by 10 o’clock at
night held the whole of the Eparges Heights. Only Combres Hill,
threatened by the machine guns of Eparges and St. Remy, remained in the
hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>The enemy had left nothing undone to put the position in a state of
defence. Their cave-shelters contained a narrow-gauge railway, sleeping
quarters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a>{33}</span> even an officers’ club. Their relief reinforcements were
concealed from the French, while their cannon and machine-guns were
unceasingly turned on the muddy slopes up which the French laboriously
climbed. Unwounded men were drowned in the mud, while many of the
wounded could not be rescued in time from the quagmires into which they
had fallen.</p>

was a costly victory. Most of the officers and thousands of men fell.

<p>Hattonchâtel stands on one of the promontories of the chain of hills
which stretches from Verdun to Toul and which separates the Valley of
the Meuse from the Plains of the Woëvre. It derives its name from a
castle built in the 9th century by Hatton, Bishop of Verdun. The
fortress has long been demolished. The church, erected as a collegiate
in 1328, but united with the Collegiate Church of Apremont in 1707,
remained standing until 1914. Since then it has been damaged by
bombardments, especially the apse and north aisle. The little 15th
century cloister, crossed by a public road, has suffered relatively
little damage.</p>

<p>The church contained the tomb of G. de Haraucourt, Bishop of Verdun
(16th century), and a remarkable altar piece. They were carried off by
the Germans, but it is hoped that they will be returned.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CELEBRATED ALTAR-SCREEN, BY LIGIER RICHIER, STOLEN BY THE
GERMANS FROM THE CHURCH OF HATTONCHÂTEL</p></div>
</div>

<p>This altar-screen, the projecting parts of which were of gold on a blue
background, is divided into three sections, separated by pilasters with
finely moulded bases.</p>

<p>On the central keystone, in the shape of a shield, are the arms of Duke
Antoine of Lorraine. Two medallions between the archivolt and the first
projection of the coping represent St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>

<p>The subjects of the three groups are: on the left, the <b>Carrying of the
Cross</b>; Christ, in a long flowing robe, is in the centre, while behind
Him stands Simon the Cyrenian wearing a pointed cap with turned-up
edges; around stands a group of three women, two of whom are easily
recognized&mdash;Mary Magdalene with long hair falling over her shoulders,
and Veronica holding the Cloth of the Holy Face. Two executioners
complete the scene.</p>

<p>In the centre of the altar-screen is <b>The Crucifixion.</b> In the foreground
is the swooning Virgin supported by St. John. Kneeling at the foot of
the Cross is Mary Magdalene, and opposite her, Stephaton holding the
long reed with a sponge dipped in vinegar. Lastly come the three
soldiers of Pilate, one of whom carries the spear which pierced Christ’s
side. On a pennant held by the second soldier are inscribed the words
which affirm the divinity of Christ: “<i>Vere hic homo filius Dei erat</i>.”</p>

<p>The third section of the altar-screen represents the <b>Burial Scene.</b> In
the background is a bishop wearing a mitre, and kneeling at his feet a
priest in a surplice. According to custom, the sculptor has here
represented the donor, doubtless Gaucher or Gauthier Richeret, Dean of
the Collegiate Church, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39"></a>{39}</span> initials, “G. R.,” frame the blazoned
shield. The bishop is St. Maur, Bishop of Verdun, whose relics belonged
to the Collegiate Church.</p>

<p>Unfortunate restorations were carried out in 1764 by Cellier Delatour,
whose name appears on the background of the third picture. The date of
the work (“<small>A.D.</small> 1.000.500.23.”) is inscribed on each of the curtains of
the four pilasters which surround it.</p>

<p>The 18th century pulpit is almost intact.</p>

<p>Behind the church there is a fine view over the Heights of the Meuse
towards Apremont.</p>

<p>In the village square is the old guard-house with an arcade, and some
old houses, most of which are uninhabitable.</p>

<p>At the end of the village, in the direction of Hattonville, are the
ruins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a>{40}</span> the old château. The cellars served as bomb-proof shelters,
the walls being several yards thick.</p>

<p>From the terrace of the château is seen the immense Plain of
Woëvre&mdash;partly occupied by the Germans from September, 1914.</p>

<h4>The Woëvre Plain</h4>

<p>The Woëvre forms a district by itself, geologically rather than
geographically, and corresponds approximately to the “<i>pays vabrensis</i>”
of the Merovingians. It lies between the Heights of the Meuse and
Moselle. The soil of marl and clay becomes a slough after rain, and
numerous pools and hidden sheets of water, known locally as
“<i>gorittis</i>,” “<i>noues</i>,” or “<i>crachettes</i>,” make the ground slippery and
treacherous.</p>

<p>Here may be followed step by step the stages of the Franco-American
offensive of September, 1918 (<i>see pp. <a href="#page_18">18-20</a></i>), which reduced the whole
salient of St. Mihiel, and advanced the lines several kilometres to the
outworks of the Forts of Metz, thus placing the Allied forces in strong
positions in readiness for the new offensive planned for November 16,
which the signing of the Armistice on November 11 prevented from being
carried out to overwhelming victory.</p>

<p><i>Leaving Hattonchâtel</i>, a German cemetery <i>will be seen on the left,

<p>Vigneulles is a country town of considerable importance, built on the
western fringe of the Woëvre Plain, at the foot of the chain of hills
which separates the latter from the Valley of the Meuse. In the original
plan of mobilisation it was to be the main French Headquarters.</p>

<p>Numerous houses have been destroyed.</p>

<p><i>From Vigneulles to St. Mihiel there is a choice of two roads</i>: one,
direct, via Chaillon (<i>Itinerary A, p. <a href="#page_41">41</a></i>); the other, less direct,
passes through Apremont, Brûlé Wood and Ailly Wood, and is much more
interesting (<i>Itinerary B, p. <a href="#page_42">42</a></i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a>{41}</span></p>

<h5>A.&mdash;From Vigneulles to St. Mihiel, via Chaillon</h5>

<p><i>At Vigneulles take G.C.D. 10 on the left, 100 yards from the church,
and follow it for about 500 yards, then take G.C. 9 on the right, which
passes through the village of</i> Creüe.</p>

<p>The woods which rise above the village form a kind of curtain, and the
Germans, well aware of its importance (the Grand French Manœuvres of
1891 had taken place in this district), seized it at the end of
September, 1914, and later built a light railway which formed their main
line of communication with St. Mihiel. Hidden in this recess, the
railway escaped observation and was worked, with but little damage,
throughout the war.</p>

<p><i>Leaving Creüe, the road follows the valley through which runs the Creüe
Brook.</i></p>

<p><i>Before entering Chaillon, the tourist passes a</i> German cemetery <i>on the
right</i>. Many of the houses in this village, as well as the church, were
destroyed.</p>

<p>Lying almost on the edge of the Forest of Apremont, Brûlé Wood commanded
the cross-roads on which the village of Apremont stands.</p>

<p>The German trenches were only fifty yards from the French lines at this
point. For months, bombs, grenades and rockets made an inferno of the
place. The proximity of the respective lines required the utmost
precautions, constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a>{47}</span> watching and listening, with finger on the
trigger of the rifle, absolute silence, no sleep and no smoking (smoking
might give an objective to the bombers). The nervous tension was so
great that the average stay of a battalion was only eight days.</p>

<p>Brûlé Wood was the scene of the sublime rallying call “<i>Debout les
Morts</i>” (Stand up, ye Dead!)&mdash;<i>see below</i>.</p>

<p>While early in April, 1915, important attacks were taking place in Ailly
Wood, the 95th Infantry Regiment was ordered to create a diversion in
Brûlé Wood. On April 5, 6 and 8 bloody fights took place for the
possession of a trench. On the morning of the 8th the captured trench
was consolidated, and the attacking troops relieved and sent in reserve
to the second line.</p>

<p>Suddenly a strong German counter-attack was launched. The new occupants

the trenches, when <i>Adjutant Jacques Péricard</i>, who had taken part in
the action the day before but was now in reserve, called for volunteers
from his company to face the enemy. The trench was retaken after a
prolonged and terrible struggle, in the course of which Péricard,
feeling his men wavering and seeing only dead and wounded around, cried
“<i>Debouts les Morts</i>.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GERMAN TRENCH UNDER THE APREMONT-ST. MIHIEL ROAD</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here the attacks took place which, between April 5 and 13, 1915, gave
the French definite mastery of the position. The Germans held one corner
of the wood and the outskirts at the foot of the slopes. The French
trenches followed the ravine, mounted half-way up the unwooded part of
the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a>{51}</span> and ran alongside the wood. The entrenchment, known as the
“<i>Le Fortin</i>,” was in the corner. In the wood the German trenches rose
in three tiers, linked together by narrow trenches. At certain points
the Germans had constructed “<i>chevaux-de-frise</i>,” twelve yards deep by
two yards high.</p>

<p>The bombardment began on the morning of the 5th. The 75’s opened
breaches in the defences, and the observers, who were only 130 yards
from the enemy line, gave accurate directions to the gunners. In their
turn, 6-in. shells crushed the machine-gun emplacements, and at mid-day
the explosion of five mine-fields annihilated the garrison and threw the
enemy into a panic. A bayonet-attack was launched at once, without the
firing of a single shot.</p>

</div>

<p>Two companies attacked on the western side of the wood, two others on
the southern side.</p>

<p>The attack on the west was successful and, going beyond the third German
line, reached the northern fringe of the wood. The machine-gunners, who
followed the advance, at once took up their positions.</p>

<p>The attack on the south, after the first rush forward, was forced to
withdraw slightly before an enfilading fire. At three o’clock in the
afternoon the German artillery thundered; at four o’clock a
counter-attack was launched<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a>{52}</span> but failed; and at 5.30 the Germans tried
to retake the lost ground by a terrific bombardment. In an hour and a
half, on a front of 360 yards, twenty thousand shells of all sizes
(4-in., 5.5-in., 6-in. and 8-in.) cut the French lines of communication,
but failed to force a retreat. The attack was resumed next day, but in
the evening, after fierce hand-to-hand fighting, the French still held
the three lines of German trenches. On the 7th and 8th they repulsed
eight counter-attacks, which left the shell-leveled ground in their
hands.</p>

<p>On the 10th, after an artillery preparation lasting all day, a fresh
attack was launched at seven o’clock in the evening. The whole of the
wood was quickly occupied and immediately consolidated, in view of
counter-attack. Five machine-guns, five trench-mortars, thousands of
grenades and large quantities of equipment and stores, were left in the
hands of the French.</p>

<p>From that time scarcely a month passed without some communiqué stating

<h4>St. Mihiel during the War</h4>

<p>On September 24, 1914, St. Mihiel was taken by the Germans, who held it
until September 12, 1918.</p>

<p>Up to the latter date only one attempt was made to retake the town&mdash;the
attack of November 17-20, 1914, during which a French unit succeeded in
occupying the suburb of Chauvoncourt, but was forced to retire as the
Germans had mined this section.</p>

<p>The Franco-American offensive of September, 1918, finally cleared St.
Mihiel.</p>

</div>

<p>General Pershing, in the disposition of his forces, generously arranged
that a French regiment, the 25th Colonial, should have the honour of
being the first to enter St. Mihiel. The Prime Minister’s son, Captain
Michel Clémenceau, was among those who marched into the town.</p>

<p>On the whole the town had suffered little. The bridges had been blown
up, trenches cut up the streets, and a German narrow-gauge railway ran
through the town. The monument of 1870, “<i>Aux Morts pour la Patrie</i>,”
was damaged. As everywhere else, all copper had been removed, the
machinery had disappeared or had been broken, while the optical-glass
factory and the copper foundry had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>On Friday, September 13, General Pershing, accompanied by General Pétain
and Mr. Baker, American Secretary of State for War, visited St. Mihiel.
The next day President Poincaré, in his turn, paid homage to the valiant
city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54"></a>{54}</span></p>

<p>Little by little, when the first excitement was over, the inhabitants
told the story of the occupation; of the war levies imposed by the
Germans, as in every town which they had occupied; first a million
francs in 1914, when the commandeering without payment or vouchers; the
fines (20 francs for omitting to salute an officer); children forced to
work in the trenches; people sent to prison, and even to the convict
prison on the slightest pretext; an abbé deported as a hostage because
he had said in a sermon, “<i>After the thorns will come the roses</i>;” a
whole family placed in solitary confinement for forty days because they
were suspected of having telephoned to the French, etc., not to mention
the systematic looting and removal of objects of art, pictures and
silver.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 10th, the Germans, knowing the attack was imminent, made
their final preparations for departure. On the 11th they ordered the
inhabitants, on pain of death, to remain indoors until noon on the
following day.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th they blew up the bridges and removed their
guns. On the morning of the 12th the French entered the town.</p>

<p>Several days later the American Headquarters which, until then, had been
at Souilly, on the road from Verdun to Bar-le-Duc, moved into St.
Mihiel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55"></a>{55}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE “SEPULCHRE,” <i>by Ligier Richier</i>, IN ST. ETIENNE’S
CHURCH</p></div>
</div>

<p>Starting point: The Church of St. Etienne.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Etienne, often called the “Eglise du Bourg,” contains
several remarkable Renaissance sculptures, chief among which are a
<b>bas-relief</b> in St. Joseph’s Chapel (<i>photo, p. <a href="#page_58">58</a></i>), a large <b>reredos</b>
behind the high altar (<i>photo, p. <a href="#page_58">58</a></i>), and above all, in the central
bay of the south aisle, behind a railing (<i>photo, p. <a href="#page_57">57</a></i>) in a sort of
grotto or crypt, the <i>chef-d’oeuvre</i> of Ligier Richier, commonly known
by the incorrect title of the “<b>Sepulchre of St. Mihiel.</b>”</p>

<h4>The “Sepulchre,” by Ligier Richier</h4>

<p>This comprises a group of thirteen figures, rather more than life size,
executed between 1554 and 1564, and placed after Richier’s death in the
church, where it stands to-day (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The figures are arranged as follows: <i>on the left</i>, Salome lays in the
coffin, the shroud which is to enwrap Christ, while two disciples,
Joseph and Nicodemus, carrying the body of their Divine Master, stand in
the foreground. Nicodemus carries the body by the shoulders, while the
unsupported head rests against his arm. Joseph of Arimathæa, one knee on
the ground, supports the legs of Our Lord. Near him Mary Magdalene helps
to carry the feet, which she touches with her lips. In the background
the Virgin, leaning on St. John, and Mary, the wife of Cleophas, turn a
last look on Christ.</p>

<p>Between Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and Salome, stands an angel bearing
the Cross&mdash;an unfounded tradition says that this is a portrait of the
artist.</p>

<p><i>On the right of the central group, and next to Nicodemus, a woman</i>,
often called Veronica, carries the crown of thorns. Behind her, in the
background, two men-at-arms are casting lots for the seamless coat. <i>At
the other end, on the right</i>, a Roman officer, often, without
justification, called the Centurion, is seated on a shield with a sword
in his left hand. He is the captain of the guard in charge of the tomb.</p>

<p>This is a strong, touching work by a French master-sculptor, who had not
yet come under Italian influence and methods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57"></a>{57}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE RAILING OF LIGIER RICHIER’S “SEPULCHRE”</p></div>
</div>

<h4>Ligier Richier</h4>

<p>Numerous legends surround the life of the “Master of St. Mihiel.” The
only son of Jean Richier, a master-sculptor, he was born at St. Mihiel
about 1500. Brought up as a Catholic, he was converted to Calvinism
about 1560. There is a legend that Michael Angelo came to St. Mihiel,
admired the work of the boy Ligier Richier, and took him to Rome; but it
is known that Michael Angelo never visited Lorraine.</p>

<p>Ligier Richier, not being able to carry out his commissions
single-handed, gathered around him apprentices and companions, who have
been called his brothers. It is true that he had a son (Gerald) in 1534,
and that the latter worked in his father’s studio, and had in his turn
five sons, also sculptors, who settled in Nancy, Metz, Lyons and
Grenoble. In 1764, in consequence of the persecution of the Protestants,
he settled in Geneva, where he died about 1567.</p>

<p>Numerous groups of sacred figures, scattered over this district, attest
the happy skill of Ligier Richier: a <b>reredos</b> of many-coloured stone in
the church at Hattonchâtel (p. <a href="#page_38">38</a>); <b>Christ Crucified</b> between the Virgin
and St. John, in the church at Génicourt, on the road from Verdun to St.
Mihiel; <b>Group of Notre Dame-de-Pitié</b>, in the Sacré-Cœur Chapel of the
church at Etain; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a>{58}</span> <b>Calvary</b> (six statues of wood variously coloured) in
the chapel of the new cemetery at Briey; a large <b>Christ carrying the
Cross</b> in the Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Pitié in the Church of St. Laurent,
at Pont-à-Mousson (p. <a href="#page_92">92</a>); and lastly, in St. Mihiel itself, two of his
masterpieces: “<b>The Swooning Virgin</b>,” in the church of St. Mihiel (p. <a href="#page_67">67</a>)
and the important group, “<b>The Sepulchre</b>” in the Church of St. Etienne
(p. <a href="#page_56">56</a>).</p>

corruption.</p>

<p>Founded in 709 on a site known to-day as St. Christopher’s Farm, in
Vieux-Moutier Wood, it was transferred in 819 to the village of
Godinécourt, which then took the name of St. Michel or St. Mihiel. It
was closed in 1791.</p>

Chauvoncourt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a>{63}</span></p>

<h4>Chauvoncourt</h4>

<p>Chauvoncourt, occupied by the Germans from the beginning of their
advance in September, 1914, was an important bridgehead which the French
had an interest in retaking. Its capture and subsequent evacuation
(November 16-18) are famous.</p>

<p>In the evening of November 16, French heavy batteries took up their
position at Fresnes-au-Mont, on the left bank of the Meuse, five miles
from St. Mihiel; but before attacking, the German howitzers on the
Paroches position had been destroyed.</p>

<p>The bombardment began at dead of night. Four hundred shells fell on the
enemy, causing the Bavarian ammunition dump to explode. At dawn, French
infantry, massed in the peninsula of Les Romains, crossed the Meuse on a
pontoon bridge, whilst the cavalry on the Fresnes road threatened
Chauvoncourt from the west. By ten o’clock the infantry were in sight of
the village. The Bavarians advanced by successive rushes&mdash;at each of
which they fired a salvo&mdash;then halted behind a little glen. The fight
became a fusilade, and would have continued indefinitely but for the
arrival of the French dragoons, who, with lances fixed, charged
furiously. The enemy, afraid of being cut off, retreated, followed by
the cavalry, who began the siege of the houses. Every window, door and
roof sheltered a Bavarian marksman. All day on the 17th the fighting
continued in favour of the French, who by night occupied the western
part of Chauvoncourt and slept in a French barracks. On the left bank of
the Meuse the Germans, two hundred of whom had surrendered, now occupied
only a few ruined houses.</p>

<p>But at five o’clock on the morning of the 18th an explosion was heard.
At the end of the main street three houses, luckily unoccupied, had been
wrecked. Orders were at once given to evacuate the occupied portion of
the town, which proved to be a wise precaution, for at eight o’clock the
whole south-west portion blew up, over an area of four acres. No
soldiers were killed, but civilians, who stayed on in spite of orders to
the contrary, were victims of their own imprudence.</p>

<p>Trenches and shelters are to be seen all along the road.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was customary to represent the Virgin standing in
contemplation of the wounds of her Divine Son, as described in the
famous chant, <i>Stabat Mater Dolorosa</i>. In the 15th century, on the
contrary, the Virgin was generally represented as described in the
Gospel of Nicodemus. In Richier’s group we see the Virgin, supported by
St. John, fainting at the foot of the Cross. The extreme simplicity of
the work renders it most pathetic.</p>

Saviour’s blood. The work was in painted walnut, as had been the custom
from the Middle Ages, but the worm-eaten wood gradually crumbled away.
In 1720 the Benedictines managed to save the crucifix and the group of
“The Swoon.” The crucifix is supposed to have been burnt during the
Revolution (1792). Now all that remains is a moulding of Christ’s head.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the Church, skirt the front of the adjoining Collège, and pass
under the arch of the Palais-de-Justice, thus reaching the</i> <b>Place des
Moines.</b> In this square is the fine façade of the old abbey, restored in
the 17th and 18th centuries, the buildings of which have been
transformed into the Hôtel de la Division, Palais-de-Justice and prison.
Above the latter is the famous monastic library containing 13,000
volumes and valuable manuscripts.</p>

<p><i>Besides the Hôtel de la Division is the</i> chevet of St. Michel Church,
<i>looking on to the square of that name. By turning to the left in the
latter, the tourist comes back to the Place du Collège, which cross to
take the Commercy road (N. 64).</i></p>

<p><i>On leaving St. Mihiel, N. 64 climbs up a steep slope. A mile from the
town, on the left, is a</i> concrete blockhouse <i>at the corner of the
Commercy road and that leading to</i> Fort Camp-des-Romains. <i>Take the
latter to the fort.</i></p>

<h4>Fort of the Camp-des-Romains</h4>

<p>This is one of the two forts which protect St. Mihiel. Standing on the
end of a narrow peninsula formed by a loop in the Meuse, it dominates
the town from a height of 450 feet above the valley. (The hill itself is
1,200 feet high.) It owes its name to the remains of Roman
entrenchments, still existing when the fort was built.</p>

<p>When the German Army of Metz occupied St. Mihiel on September 24, 1914,
and crossed the Meuse, the Fort of the Camp des Romains remained
isolated, without troops in the plain to defend it, and absolutely
dependent on its own guns. The Germans left it alone for the time being,
confident of being able to take it whenever they wished. The 16th Corps
hastened to the rescue, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a>{70}</span> stopped in front of St. Mihiel. The Germans
finally dug themselves in and were able, from a position near the town,
to begin the bombardment of the fort with the aid of Austrian heavy
guns.</p>

<p>The guns were very quickly placed in position, and in a few days they
silenced those of the French fort, the turrets and bastions of which
were destroyed. In the end the heroic garrison were smoked out by the
enemy, who had reached the base of the fort. When the surviving
defenders, half suffocated, were able to leave the ruins, the Germans
presented arms as a tribute of admiration for their valour, and
permitted the captured officers to retain their swords.</p>

<p>All this sector, with a few slight changes, was to remain in the hands
of the Germans until September, 1918.</p>

<p>In spite of the terrific gunfire to which it was subjected, the fort was
not completely destroyed. In the moats and on the bastions are numerous
concrete blockhouses built by the Germans. Near the entrance is the
grave of Captain of Artillery Cordebard, killed in 1914.</p>

<p>From the fort there is a fine view on all sides over the valley of the
Meuse and the Forest of Apremont.</p>

<p>The 13th-14th century Church of Bouconville with its three naves is very
curious.</p>

<p>In the cemetery are numerous French graves.</p>

<p>The front line, after passing south of Apremont, continued first to the
right of the Bouconville road, then crossed the road to the west of
Vargévaux Pond, making a bend to include the latter within the French
lines, as also the village of Xivray, which was the junction of the
French armies with the American divisions. It then passed through the
hamlet of Seicheprey, and at Flirey rejoined the main road leading to
Pont-à-Mousson.</p>

<p><i>Keep along the road towards</i> <b>Rambucourt.</b></p>

<p><i>A little before this village, N. 58 is picked up again.</i> All the way
the road is camouflaged and bordered by numerous trenches. <b>Rambucourt</b>
was badly damaged. Numerous shelters were made along the road against

<p><b>Mort-Mare Wood</b> is famous for the terrible struggles that took place for
its possession.</p>

<p>It was while reconnoitring over this wood in an aeroplane that <i>Senator
Reymond</i> was killed on October 22, 1914. He was returning from a flight
over Mars-la-Tour, Chambley and Thiaucourt, with Pilot Adjutant
Clamadieu, and the machine was turning to the right of the southern edge
of the wood, when it was seen descending, apparently normally, between
the French and German lines. Machine-guns at once opened fire; the
Adjutant was killed and Senator Reymond wounded. The French came out of
their trenches and a fierce struggle, which lasted until night, took
place round the machine. Only then was Reymond able to crawl into the
lines, while the French carried back the body of the Adjutant.</p>

<p>Reymond was taken to the hospital at Toul, and was able, before he died,
to give an exact account of the mission in the fulfilment of which he
had met such a glorious end.</p>

<p><i>On reaching the crest, the road crosses the</i> old German first-lines

At the end of September, 1914, a bloody engagement took place there. Up
to the end of March, 1915, this unfortunate village was continuously
bombarded, and it was entirely demolished when, on April 2, 1915, it was
taken by a French battalion (169th Infantry). Its capture was the
prelude to the last series of attacks which, after seven months of
terrific fighting, ended on May 31, in the capture of <b>Prêtre Wood.</b></p>

<p>Fey-en-Haye is now merely a heap of ruins. A number of trenches run
through it, and a few shelters still exist.</p>

<p>For a long time Regniéville was the advance-post of the French line
between Mort-Mare Wood, <i>on the left</i>, and Prêtre Wood, <i>on the right</i>.
At the beginning of April, 1915, the French advance was especially
dangerous for the enemy, whose counter-attacks became more frequent. It
was evident that the slightest advance in the direction of Thiaucourt
would hamper the German communications between Metz and St. Mihiel, and
would hinder the revictualling of the troops as well as the steady
supply of reinforcements and munitions. That is why, on April 9, the
Germans made fifteen successive attacks to drive the French from their
trenches and the edge of Mort-Mare Wood.</p>

most famous castles of the Middle Ages. Built by the Dukes of Lorraine,
it was dismantled by Richelieu. It formed a square flanked by high,
strong towers connected with one another by walls and subterranean
passages hollowed out of the rock. At one end there was a second
building, also surrounded by moats and flanked by towers, in one of
which was the famous “<i>Mande-Guerre</i>” bell. The keep with the chapel and

</div>

<h3>PONT-À-MOUSSON<br /><br />
Origin and Chief Historical Events</h3>

<p>Pont-à-Mousson is an old town, in whose archives are found deeds dating
back to 896 and 905. At that time it was called “<i>Villa Pontus sub
castro Montionis</i>” (The Town of the Bridge under the Castle of Monçon).</p>

<p>In the 16th century there was a long controversy between the professors
of the University and those of the Jesuit College as to whether the town
(“Pont”) or the castle (“Monçon” or “Mousson”) should have precedence,
<i>i.e</i>. if one should say “<i>Ponti Mussum</i>” or “<i>Mussi Pontum</i>.” The
dispute was settled and the name “<i>Ponti Mussum</i>” (Pont-à-Mousson)
decreed by Duke Charles III. Nevertheless, the inhabitants still insist
on calling themselves “<i>Mussipontins</i>.”</p>

<p>Renaud I., Count of Bar, living a retired life in his château of
Mousson, founded near the town in 1106 a priory dedicated to St. Michel,
which he gave to the Abbey of St. Mihiel. In 1239 the “<i>Messins</i>”
(inhabitants of Metz) broke down the bridge to prevent the Count of Bar
communicating with his castle, but three years later they joined the
Count of Bar against Duke Mathieu who, in revenge, burned down the
little town of Pont.</p>

<p>Enfranchised in 1263 by Count Thiébaut II., Pont-à-Mousson was raised to
a marquisate in 1355 by Emperor Charles IV., and, in 1356, was granted
the rights and privileges of an imperial town.</p>

<p>Charles-the-Bold took possession of it in 1476, but it was retaken later
by Duke René. However, the defection of his Swiss troops forced him to
surrender it again to the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>What made the glory and prosperity of the town was the foundation of a
University in 1572. The influx of students and the renown of the
professors made Pont-à-Mousson famous until 1763, when the University
was transferred to Nancy.</p>

<p>The University encouraged the establishment of printing works, and
volumes printed by Marchand and Melchior Bernard are still justly
prized.</p>

<p>Although an open town, Pont-à-Mousson was violently bombarded by the
Germans as early as August 11, 1914. After a short occupation the town
was liberated by the French on September 13, 1914. The bombardments were
resumed and lasted till the end of the war.</p>

<p>As to the part played by Pont-à-Mousson in the <b>Battle for the Grand
Couronné Heights</b>, see the Michelin Guide, “<b>Nancy and the Grand
Couronné.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a>{90}</span>”</p>

<p><i>A little further on is the</i> <b>Maison Leguy</b>, recognisable by its hexagonal
turret, which rests on one of the corner pillars of the arcades.
Tradition attributes its construction to the Templars, and says that a
subterranean passage led from it across the Moselle and up to Mousson.</p>

<p><i>The turret is at the corner of Rue Victor-Hugo, which take to see, in
the Rue de l’Union (first street on the left), two curious doors at Nos.
6 and 8.</i></p>

<p><i>Return to Place Duroc, turn to the left into Rue St. Laurent and see,
in the court of No. 9</i>, a fine gallery delicately carved in Renaissance
style (slightly damaged by the bombardment); <i>at No. 11</i>, a handsome
façade with a charming court, an old well, the railing of the old
terrace, a spiral staircase and timbered ceilings; <i>at No. 19</i>, the
façade, door and entrance.</p>

<p>The very narrow façade is in florid pointed style. The interior of the
church has undergone numerous unfortunate restorations. In the aisles
are: <i>on the left</i>, the funeral statues of a 14th century knight and his
wife; <i>on the right</i>, the tomb of Esther of Apremont, with her
coat-of-arms (1592), and a particularly interesting late 16th century
sepulchre (<i>see photos, p. <a href="#page_94">94</a></i>).</p>

<p>A triforium runs round the nave, and the tribune is closed by a fine
open-work gallery dating from the end of the 16th century.
Unfortunately, the choir is disfigured by a facing of marble which
conceals the frescoes that decorated the walls.</p>

<p>The village of Mousson is at the top of a hill where there have been
successively: a Roman camp, an Austrasian fortress and, in the 10th
century, the château of the Countess Sophie de Bar, reduced to ruins by
<i>Richelieu</i>.</p>

<p>The fortifications consist of a first-line covering the village, and a
second surrounding the château. The houses thus form a semicircle
between the two ramparts.</p>

<p>The village was greatly damaged during the war. Most of the houses are
in ruins. Some of them had tricusped windows and curious 15th and 16th
century doors.</p>

<p>The chapel (<i>Hist. Mon.</i>), with a semicircular vaulted roof on curious
pillars, contains fine baptismal fonts (1085) decorated with sculptures.</p>

<p>These fonts, resembling the curb-stone of a well, are decorated with
bas-reliefs representing: <i>John the Baptist preaching repentance to
publicans and soldiers who came to him in the wilderness; John baptizing
two naked Jews immersed in a cistern; John baptizing Jesus Christ,
plunged up to the waist in the waters of Jordan.</i></p>

<p>On the terrace are numerous trenches, in addition to shafts dug by the
engineers to reach the underground passages which communicate with
concrete shelters. One of these shelters may still be seen along the
southern ramparts of the old château. All these military works are very
interesting to visit.</p>

<p>There is a <b>splendid panorama</b> from this terrace: <i>on one side</i> (<i>photo,
pp.</i> 100 and 101) the town of Pont-à-Mousson and the valley of the
Moselle with, behind Pont-à-Mousson, Puvenelle Forest and Prêtre Wood;
<i>on the other side</i>, the valley of the Seille, with Metz Cathedral in
the distance. <i>To the south-east is seen</i> the Grand Couronné.</p>

<p>Mousson was a first-rate observation-post for the French gunners, which

<h3>A VISIT TO PRÊTRE WOOD</h3>

<h4>The Fighting in Prêtre Wood</h4>

<p>Prêtre Wood dominates all the southern part of the Plain of Woëvre
(altitude: 1,200 feet).</p>

<p>From October, 1914, to May, 1915, it was the scene of a continual
struggle, at the end of which the wood remained in the hands of the
French.</p>

<p>It was in September, 1914, that the Germans installed themselves in
Prêtre Wood, which they at once fortified with barbed wire,
chevaux-de-frise, etc.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1914, the French obtained a footing in the
south-western edges of the forest. A month later (October 29) they
captured a German post in the south-eastern salient. Their efforts were
next concentrated on Père Hilarion Ravine, which they gradually occupied
after many fights in the rain and snow of November and December.</p>

<p>Their troops advanced by short rushes as far as the principal line,
which had to be taken by a direct attack. First, artillery was brought
up by night to prepare the attack. Sappers, by long and patient sapping,
blew up the minor defences and penetrated the blockhouses. The
adversaries were at times less than a hundred yards apart.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span></p>

<p>From January, 1915, the French operations were directed against the
western portion, towards Quart-en-Réserve and Croix des Carmes Hill.
Four lines of trenches bristling with machine-guns and defences held up
the attack. The ground had to be taken bit by bit, and often a
counter-attack would win back in the evening the gains of several days’
hard fighting. The first line was carried on January 17, and the second
on February 16. At this point aerial torpedoes and hand grenades caused
progress to slow down. The third line was captured on March 30. Attacks
and counter-attacks followed. Fighting with hand grenades took place in
the communicating trenches, behind barrages, and the artillery on both
sides covered this narrow strip of ground with projectiles, breaking
down the parapets and destroying the communicating trenches. The
Germans, who lost heavily, brought up endless reinforcements&mdash;in all
about sixteen battalions&mdash;thus showing the importance which they
attached to this position.</p>

<p>The final attack was launched on May 12. The French carried the
blockhouses and the northern slopes beyond the crest, but the enemy
still clung to the eastern and western slopes. However, the wood was
won, and the splendid observation-post which the hill afforded was
thenceforth in the hands of the French.</p>

<p>In the little cemetery on the hillside hundreds of heroes sleep their
last sleep.</p>

<p>The slopes near the road throughout this district are one vast cemetery,
while the wood proper hides beneath its soil hundreds of dead entombed
by the explosion of mines or the falling-in of trenches.</p>

<p>This wood of tragic memories was called by the Germans “<i>The Wood of
Death</i>,” or “<i>The Widows’ Wood</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span>”</p>

<p>This village did not suffer much. <i>On entering, there are</i> several large
concrete machine-gun blockhouses <i>on the right</i>.</p>

<p>The nearest dressing station was at Montauville, in the cellar of a
ruined house. First aid was given in the trenches or in the little hut
near the big oak tree. From Montauville the wounded were taken in motors
to Pont-à-Mousson. There was a constant procession of ambulances,
stretcher-bearers and hospital attendants on the road.</p>

<h2><a name="METZ" id="METZ"></a>METZ<br /><br />
ORIGIN AND CHIEF HISTORICAL FACTS</h2>

<p>The origin of Metz dates back to the Celtic epoch, when it was the
capital of the <i>Mediomatrici</i>. The Romans fortified it, to defend the
frontiers of the empire against the barbarians. Metz then became the
centre of six great Roman roads leading to distant provinces: two from
Metz to Rheims, two from Metz to Trèves (one on the right, the other on
the left bank of the Moselle), one from Metz to Strasburg, and one from
Metz to Mainz.</p>

<p>A very rich and populous town, it was embellished by numerous Roman
buildings, of which excavations have laid bare important remains: an
<b>amphitheatre</b>, near Porte Mazelle, and above all <b>Gorze Aqueduct</b> (4th
century), more than thirteen miles in length, which brought water from
Gorze to Metz. Some fine remains of the aqueduct may still be seen at
Jouy-aux-Arches.</p>

<p>The Roman Emperors who visited Metz stayed at the Governors’ Palace,
which stood in Place St. Croix.</p>

<p>Metz was taken and laid waste by the Huns in 451.</p>

<p>Half a century later it was rebuilt and, on the death of Clovis (511),
became the capital of Austrasia and the cradle of the Carolingian
dynasty. Louis-le-Débonnaire was buried in the Abbey of St. Arnoul. The
Treaty of Verdun (843) gave it to Lothaire, who made it the capital of
his kingdom Lotharingia (afterwards Lorraine). Thirty years later the
Treaty of Mersen (870) handed it over to Louis the Germanic.</p>

<p>It was governed, in the name of the emperor, first by the counts and
later by the bishops. In 1220, on the death of Count Thiébault, the town
became a sort of republic under the title of “Free Imperial Town,” and
was governed by the sheriffs until 1552.</p>

<p>Under Henri II. the French, led by Montmorency, occupied the town, after
a treaty concluded with Maurice of Saxony. The Duke of Guise, appointed
Governor, energetically defended Metz, besieged by Emperor Charles-Quint
(October 19, 1552). On January 1, 1553, Charles-Quint raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span> the siege,
after having lost 30,000 men. For a long time the kings of France bore
the title of “Protector.” Henri III. was the first to call himself
“Sovereign Ruler.” The Parliament of Metz, created in 1633, completed
the ruin of its municipal independence, and the Treaty of Westphalia
(1648) definitely incorporated it with France. It was the capital of the
“Three Bishoprics” formed by the union of Metz, Toul and Verdun.</p>

<p>Until the Revolution (1789) Metz, while escaping the horrors of war,
constantly felt its effects. Troops were continually passing through it,
and its barracks became a mustering-ground. Turenne, Villars, the
Marquis de Créquy, and Marshal de Villeroy camped within its walls, and
it was at Metz that in August, 1744, Louis XV. was taken seriously ill,
on which occasion the whole of France prayed and fasted for their
“well-beloved” King.</p>

<p>In 1790, Metz became the chief town of the new “Département” of Moselle.
Two sieges, in 1814 and 1815, were victoriously resisted.</p>

<p>1870 was a black year in the annals of the town&mdash;till then known as
“<i>Virgin Metz</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The battles of Borny (August 14), Rézonville (August
15), St. Privat (August 18), forced <i>Marshal Bazaine</i> to retire under
the walls of the town. He resisted feebly, contenting himself with
awaiting events, and did not even attempt to cut his way through, which
would have saved the honour of the armies under his command. On October
28 he signed the capitulation, and on the following day surrendered with
173,000 men, 60 generals, 6,000 officers, 58 standards, 622 field-guns,
876 siege-guns, 72 machine-guns, 260,000 rifles and huge quantities of
stores and munitions. Six months later (May 10, 1871), by the Treaty of
Frankfort, Metz and part of the “<i>département</i>” of Moselle were ceded to
Germany. Metz thus became the capital of German Lorraine.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Its coat-of-arms consists of an escutcheon argent and sable
surmounted by a maiden crowned by towers and holding a palm in her left
hand. It was, in fact, the proudest claim of Metz, until 1870, that it
had never been taken since it had become a fortified city. In 1815 the
armies of the “Holy Alliance” were refused permission to march through,
when they evacuated French territory, and were obliged to cross the
Moselle over a bridge which the people of Metz erected at the very foot
of the ramparts, just outside the town.</p></div>

<p>It was from Metz that <b>La Fayette</b> set out in 1775 on his immortal
expedition to help America win her freedom and independence. In grateful
remembrance of that glorious event the “<b>Knights of Columbus</b>” recently
decided to erect a statue of La Fayette in Metz (<i>to be inaugurated in
1920</i>).</p>

<h4>The Fortifications</h4>

<p>From its position Metz was destined to become a stronghold of the first
importance. The Romans fortified the town built by the Gauls, and
erected the first citadel. The walls were preserved for a long time, and
Bishop Robert, in the 10th century, utilised their remains. It was only
in the 12th century that the new ramparts included the island formed by
the two arms of the Moselle. They consisted of a high wall protected by
sixty-eight towers. In 1552 the Duke of Guise commissioned an engineer,
<i>Pierre Strozzi</i>, to restore these fortifications, which had withstood
two sieges (1444 and 1552), and were in a dilapidated condition. Four
years later (1556) Marshal de Vieilleville erected a citadel flanked by
four bastions, on the site of the old convents. This citadel (which
remained standing until 1802) stood on the site of the present
Esplanade.</p>

<p>About a century later <i>Vauban</i>, fully aware of the strategic value of
Metz, conceived a great scheme, which was carried out in the 18th
century by an engineer, <i>M. Cormontaigne</i>. Vauban, for his part, added
eleven new bastions to those which already guarded the citadel, but it
was <i>Cormontaigne</i> who perfected the plans for inundating the valley of
the Seille by utilising the waters of Lindre Pond.</p>

<p>Metz became finally one of the most formidable fortresses of Europe.</p>

<p>Under Louis-Philippe the fortifications were entirely restored, and in
1866 preparations were made to rebuild them on a new plan, better
adapted to the exigencies of modern armaments and technique. Of the four
detached forts of St. Quentin, Plappeville, Queuleu and St. Julien, only
the first two were completed in 1870.</p>

<p>The Germans considerably strengthened the fortifications by means of
nineteen bastions surrounded by moats, the latter being protected by
thirteen out-works. The length of the line of forts was increased to
eighteen miles, and eleven new forts were added.</p>

<p><i>After the ceremony</i>: President Poincaré embraces Prime Minister

<p>The march past took place on the Esplanade, before General Pétain, made
Marshal that morning. Mounted on a white horse and wearing his large
blue coat, he had taken his stand in front of the statue of Marshal Ney.
He was assisted by General Fayolle, commanding a group of armies, and by
Major-General Buat. General Mangin, commanding the 10th Army, had met
with an accident while riding, and his place was taken by General
Leconte. On the same day M. Mirman, who had been appointed Commissioner
of the Republic, was received by General de Maud’huy, Governor of Metz.
Salvos of cannon and the ringing of the famous “Mutte” bell in the
Cathedral celebrated this joyful day.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, November 24, the leading men of Metz elected
the new Town Council, and decided to restore the names of the streets in
use prior to 1870, and to name new streets after generals and prominent
men who had distinguished themselves in the Great War. The list was
published in a decree dated December 7.</p>

<p>On Sunday, December 8, President Poincaré, accompanied by the French
Prime Minister, M. Clémenceau, the Presidents of the Chambers,
Ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>{119}</span> Marshals, and French and Allied Generals, proclaimed the
definite return to France of the lost provinces. It was a day never to
be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Young girls in the national
costume of Lorraine&mdash;birthplace of the French President&mdash;marched through
the streets, and flowers were showered from the windows on the
procession.</p>

<p>In the morning there was a review on the Esplanade, and a
Field-Marshal’s <i>bâton</i> was presented to General Pétain. The President
of the Republic opened the proceedings with an address, after which an
unforeseen and touching incident occurred; overcome with emotion, M.
Poincaré and M. Clémenceau embraced each other.</p>

President Poincaré summed up in a stirring speech the whole history of
Metz, and concluded with the following words:&mdash;</p>

to Mars-la-Tour, by visits to the cemeteries, and by fostering
French memories.... Beloved town of Metz, your nightmare is
over&mdash;France returns and opens her arms to you!”</p></div>

<p>The procession was then received with great ceremony by Mgr. Felt at the
Cathedral, and finally went to the cemetery of Chambière, to pay homage
to the dead of 1870.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>{120}</span></p>

<h3>A VISIT TO METZ</h3>

<p><b>Starting-point</b>: the Place d’Armes.</p>

<p>The Place d’Armes, in which the Cathedral and the Hôtel-de-Ville stand,
is a handsome square embellished with noble buildings. On its site
formerly stood the Cathedral cloister, the musicians’ quarters, several
chapels and private houses.</p>

<p>In 1753 the Governor, <i>Marshal de Belle-Isle</i>, decided that a square
should be laid out there and a portal erected giving access to the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The plans of the architect (<i>Blondel</i>) for the portal made it necessary
to lower the level of the ground. For months and years, canons and
sheriffs alike stopped or impeded the work. During the night of August
9, 1755, M. de Belle-Isle called out the garrison, and had the work
finished by torchlight. By morning the excavation was complete.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Place d’Armes stands a <i>statue of Marshal Fabert</i> (<i>by Etex</i>,
1840). The only inscription on the statue of the great Metz general
(1599-1662), who was governor of Sedan, is one of his own sayings: “<i>If,
to prevent the enemy taking a place entrusted to my care by the king, it
were necessary, I should not hesitate for an instant to sacrifice
myself, my family, and all my belongings.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>{122}</span>”</p>

</div>

<h4>The Cathedral</h4>

<p>The whole of one side of the Place d’Armes is occupied by the Cathedral
of St. Etienne, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. The body of the
church reminds one of Amiens and Beauvais. If, on the outside, it
appears somewhat narrow, the interior (393 feet long, 71 feet wide, 139
feet high), with its magnificent stained-glass, is imposing and of
exceeding beauty.</p>

<p>The oldest portions of the Cathedral date from the 13th century.</p>

<p>The nave, completed in the 14th century, has eight bays. At the fourth
bay it is flanked by two square towers.</p>

<p>The northern tower, called the “Mutte” Tower, contains the town-bell. It
is surmounted by a fine spire, from which there is an extensive view of
the surrounding country. It was there that the city watchman was
installed, whose duty it was to give the alarm in case of fire. On the
other side of the nave stands the Chapter Tower, which was finished in
1839. There is a fine doorway at the foot of each tower.</p>

<p>Another, smaller polygonal tower, called the Clock Tower, is built over
the southern aisle.</p>

<p>On each side of the choir, where it meets the arms of the transept, are
the two small “Charlemagne” towers, so called in memory of those which
existed in the romanesque building. They give access by spiral stairways
to the outside terraces over the Cathedral.</p>

<p>While the nave is 13th century the transept dates from the 15th, and the
choir, built over a great sepulchral crypt, is contemporary with the
last Gothic period.</p>

<p>Although completed in 1546 the Cathedral later underwent many
alterations. Fires necessitated repairs, and in 1753, by order of the
Governor (Marshal de Belle-Isle), the laying out of a square in front of
the Cathedral necessitated the demolition of the outbuildings of the
bishop’s house and the erection of a portal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>INTERIOR OF METZ CATHEDRAL</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ground was excavated to a depth of some eight or nine feet, and the
architect (<i>J. B. Blondel</i>) was instructed to prepare plans on a grand
scale.</p>

<p>This was done between 1761 and 1764, after which the work was at once
put in hand, and completed in 1771. While endeavouring to respect the
old building, Blondel sought, not so much to build the portal in the
style of the Cathedral, as to erect an independent portal in front of
the church. Its irregular lines contrast with the general style of the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>In 1791, the rood-loft, old altars and vaults were removed, in
accordance with the plans of <i>Gardeur Lebrun</i>. The roof, destroyed by
fire on the night of May 6, 1877&mdash;the day Emperor Wilhelm I. entered
Metz&mdash;was replaced in 1880-1882 by a copper roof several yards higher
than the original.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Doric projection of the main front was pulled down in 1903
to make room for a portal planned in the style of the rest of the
church. Statues of the prophets were carved at the corners, one of
which&mdash;that of the prophet Daniel&mdash;is a <i>likeness of the ex-Emperor of
Germany, Wilhelm II</i>. The people of Metz would not have the
ex-Kaiser-prophet take part in the entry of the French, and during the
night bound his hands with a chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span> attached to which was a board
bearing the inscription, “<i>Sic transit Gloria Mundi</i>” (thus passes away
man’s glory) (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p><i>Statue on Metz Cathedral.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The offending statue is to be replaced by a work of the Metz sculptor
<i>Hannaux</i>, who designed the French monument at Noisseville.</p>

<p>In no other church is there so large an area of window space. It is
calculated that in the transept and choir there are 4,071 square metres
of glass and it is no exaggeration to say that the whole building seems
to be one immense window.</p>

<p>Among the windows are several dating from the 13th century. The large
rose-window at the end of the nave, which dates from the 14th century,
is the work of the master-glassworker Hermann. The windows of the north
transept and the Chapel of Our Lady date from the 15th century.</p>

<p>Those of the south transept, Chapel of St. Nicholas, choir and apse are
16th century.</p>

<p>The bell called “La Mutte,” which hangs in the tower of the same name,
did not belong to the church, but to the town. The present bell, which
is rung on all special occasions, was cast in 1505. It weighs thirteen
tons and, when set in motion, causes the large and small spires to rock
perceptibly. It bears the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dame Mutte suis baptisée,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">De par la Cité ci-posée,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span></p>

<p>The best view of Metz and the surrounding country is to be obtained from
the top of the Cathedral tower. Here one realizes the immense importance
of the forts, of which the Moselle is a kind of natural moat. On the
left bank the steeply rising hills form natural defences, while the
lower hills on the right bank are reinforced by the line of forts. From
their gleam in the distance one gets a better idea of the number of
waterways which surround and run through Metz&mdash;the River Seille, the
streams of St. Pierre, Noisseville, and Châtel-St.-Germain, the River
Moselle (which divides), and the canal running parallel to it. Before
Metz lies the large island of St. Symphorion; then, near the Wadrineau
dyke, the smaller island of Saulcy. At the foot of old Metz there is yet
another arm of the Moselle, which divides, forming an island, on which
stand the Prefecture and Theatre. Beyond lies the large island of
Chambière, recognisable by its parade-ground and cemeteries.</p>

</div>

<h4>The Hôtel-de-Ville</h4>

<p>On leaving the Cathedral the tourist should next visit the Town Hall,
also in the Place d’Armes (1766-1771). The architecture is simple:
façade embellished with two pediments and handsome railings. A portico
leads to a fine staircase. Opposite the balustrade is a bas-relief in
white marble on which are engraved the famous lines of Ausonius: “<i>Salve
magna parens frugumque virumque Mosella</i>....” (“Hail, O Moselle!
illustrious mother of fruits and of men.”)</p>

<p>In the interior are large reception-rooms, in which the public meetings
of the Academy are held. The <b>Academy of Metz</b> was founded in 1760 by
Marshal de Belle-Isle under the title of “The Royal Society of
Literature, Science and Art,” and endowed with the sum of sixty thousand
“livres.” Suppressed at the Revolution, then restored on March 14, 1819,
with the motto “Useful,” it obtained the title of “Royal Academy” from
Charles X. on September 5, 1828. It consists of thirty-six titular
members, eighteen resident members, and four honorary corresponding and
associate members. The Academy largely contributed to maintain French
culture in Lorraine during the German annexation.</p>

<p>In the grand staircase there are three windows, erected in 1852, <i>in the
middle</i>, the Duke of Guise after the siege of Metz; <i>on the right</i>,
Bishop Bertram of Metz; <i>on the left</i>, Sheriff Pierre Baudoche
(1464-1489).</p>

<p>The flag which now flies over the building is the one which was there
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>{127}</span> 1870, and which was carefully preserved in the Carnavalet Museum in
Paris. It was restored to the Mayor of Metz by the Vice-President of the
Town Council of Paris on December 25, 1918.</p>

<p>The “grateful people” dragged this statue off its pedestal into the mud
a few days before the French entered the town, and on the night of
January 6 replaced it with a statue <i>“To the Victorious Poilu,” bearing
the inscription “On les a”</i> (variation of the famous rallying cry “<i>On
les aura</i>”) as a pleasant surprise for Marshal Pétain who, next day, was
to decorate sixteen regiments with the “fourragère” cord and bestow
decorations on various officers and soldiers. This statue was made in
seven days by the local sculptor Bouchard (<i>photos, p. <a href="#page_128">128</a></i>).</p>

<p><i>In the Esplanade stands the Palais-de-Justice (1776), on the site of
the former</i> Hôtel de la Haute-Pierre, the property of the Duke of
Suffolk, lover of Mary Tudor, Queen of England. He had this mansion
pulled down and the fine Hôtel de Suffolk built, which, for a long time,
served as the Government House. Finally, in 1776, <i>Clairisseaux</i> built
the present palace. The <b>iron railings</b> of the grand staircase and, <i>in
the inner court</i>, <b>two bas-reliefs</b>&mdash;one recalling the humanity of the
Duke of Guise in succouring the soldiers of the Duke of Albe after the

<p><i>At the end of the square, take Rue Saulnerie to the right (continued on
the left by Rue du Paradis), which leads to Rue des Capucins. At the end
of the latter is Place des Maréchaux, in which stands the</i> Church of St.
Ségolène, built on the site of an oratory founded by St. Ségolène in the
8th century. The present church, built at two different periods (the
choirs, nave and portal are earlier than the aisles), dates from about
the 13th century. Long, narrow windows, mostly double, end in
stanchions. The two side chapels contain fine stained-glass. Note the
curious open-work gallery of the organ loft, and several interesting
paintings.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the left and take the Rue des Trinitaires. Skirt an old
building with a square turret, beside a doorway</i>&mdash;“Hostel St.
Ligier”&mdash;<i>then turn to the right into Rue de la Bibliothèque</i>.</p>

<p><i>In this street, at the corner of Rue Chèvremont, there is</i> a large
building (formerly the Church of the Petits-Carmes), <i>the work of
Sébastian Leclerc</i>, in which are housed both the library (80,000 volumes
and 1,987 manuscripts) and the Museum (local archæology, natural
history, objects of art and three rooms of pictures).</p>

<p><i>Besides the museum, take Rue Chèvremont, which runs into Rue de la
Boucherie, in which turn to the left to St. Georges Bridge over the
Moselle.</i></p>

<p><i>Cross this bridge, from which there is a lovely view, and take the Rue
du Pont St. Georges. Rue Chambière opens at once on the right, and leads
to</i> <b>Chambière Cemetery</b>, in which are the graves of the French soldiers
who fell in the siege of 1870.</p>

<p><i>The road passes between the large slaughter house and cattle market,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>{135}</span> huts serving as an army stores.</i> <i>Cross an</i> old cemetery, in the
middle of which are several monumental tombs. <i>Skirt the Jewish cemetery
and the Moselle, as far as the</i> <b>Military Cemetery</b>: numerous graves under
the trees. In the centre stands a pyramid thirty-seven feet high, with a
great number of piled up coffins carved on the base. Here lie the
soldiers who died in the Metz hospitals of wounds received in the
battles of Borny, Gravelotte, St. Privat, Servigny, Peltre and
Ladonchamps&mdash;7,203 in number.</p>

<p>On the principal façade is a bas-relief in white marble representing
religion, taken from a disused vault belonging to the <i>de Salse</i> family.
On the other side are inscriptions. At the base of the pyramid is the
inscription: “<i>The Women of Metz to those whom they nursed.</i>”</p>

<p>Beside the pyramid there is a monument to the memory of the fallen
French officers.</p>

<p>For forty-eight years wreaths, tri-colour cockades and ribbons were
piously placed on these graves, and on each anniversary day the women of
Metz covered them with flowers.</p>

<p>Founded in 1668, the choir, nave and aisles were begun in 1680 by
<i>Spinga</i>, an Italian. The portal was damaged during the Revolution.
To-day the church forms part of the college founded by the Jesuits. A
fine cloister with a well should be visited.</p>

<p><i>Return to Rue des Bénédictins and follow it as far as Rue St. Vincent
(on the left), which leads to the square of the same name, where stands
the curious</i> <b>Church of St. Vincent</b>, founded in 1248.</p>

<p>Partially destroyed by fire in 1711, by an apostate monk, it was used as
a stable during the Revolution, and then as a hospital in 1814. Once
more a church, a portal in composite style was added. The graceful nave
on twelve shafted pillars, the symmetrical choir and the fine chapels in
pointed style are well worth seeing.</p>

<p><i>Continue along Rue St. Vincent, on the other side of the square. Its

<h3>ETAIN</h3>

<p>Etain was looted by the Swedes in 1622, during the reign of Louis XIII.
Later, it was often taken and retaken by the French, Germans, Spaniards
and Lorrains. Its fortifications were destroyed under Louis XIV. By the
Treaty of Vienna (18th century) the town was definitely ceded to France.</p>

<p>In October, 1792, Kellermann’s advance guards, in pursuit of the
Prussians, encamped at Etain.</p>

<p>In 1914, the town was bombarded by the Germans on August 24, from 1 p.m.
to 2 a.m. the next day, and again on the 25th at 11 o’clock, with
incendiary shells.</p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants were killed on the 24th. On the 25th others, who
had taken refuge in the cellars of the Town Hall, perished under the
ruins of that building. 200 fled along the Verdun road. A girl
telephonist remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a>{143}</span> at her post and kept in touch with Verdun every
quarter of an hour. Her last message (on the 25th) was: “A bomb has just
fallen on the office.”</p>

<p>The same day French troops routed the German XXXIIIrd D.R. in a glorious
battle at Etain. Nevertheless, the enemy occupied the town, which was
systematically looted. Every two days train-loads of furniture, linen,
wines, food, cloth, boots, tools and raw materials were sent to Germany.</p>

<p>In April, 1915, French troops captured Hills 219 and 221, Hôpital Farm
(formerly belonging to Order of St. Jean de Rhodes) and Haut-Bois Farm,
reaching the immediate vicinity of the town, without, however, entering
it.</p>

<p class="cb">BEAUTIFUL FRANCE</p>

<p class="c"><i>Paris and its environs</i></p>

<p class="nind"><i>PARIS</i>&mdash;home of grandeur, elegance, and wit&mdash;plays a part in France
probably unequalled in any other country, and may be considered, in many
respects, as the chief city of Europe, and one of the greatest in the
world. Above all, it possesses eminently national qualities which ten
centuries of refinement and taste have handed down to contemporary
France.</p>

<p>
It is impossible, in a few lines, to paint the exceptional charms of
Paris which the whole world admires.</p>

<p>
Its vistas of the Champs-Elysées seen from the Tuileries and the Arc de
Triomphe; of Notre-Dame and the point of the City Island seen from La
Concorde Bridge; of the River Seine, the Institute, the Louvre, seen
from the Pont-Neuf embankment; Notre-Dame and its quays, seen from the
end of St. Louis Island; the panorama of the city seen from the top of
Montmartre Hill; the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Boulogne
itself, etc., etc.,&mdash;all are of incomparable beauty.</p>

<p>
The city’s historical monuments are of inestimable value, and the most
famous art treasures are to be found in its Museums.</p>

<p>
The surroundings of Paris join the charm of their landscapes to the
world-wide fame of their parks and castles: <i>Versailles</i>, whose palace
and park recall the splendor of the Louis XIV. period, and where the
“Trianons” have preserved graceful traces of the Court of
Marie-Antoinette; <i>St. Germain</i> with its castle and forest; <i>St. Cloud</i>
and its park; <i>Sèvres</i> and its world-renowned art porcelain factory; <i>La
Malmaison</i>, home of Bonaparte before he became Napoleon I.;
<i>Rambouillet</i>, <i>Fontainebleau</i>, <i>Chartres</i> with its marvelous cathedral,
<i>Maintenon</i>, <i>Dreux</i>, etc.&mdash;all these form a girdle round Paris such as
no other metropolis in the world can boast of.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
